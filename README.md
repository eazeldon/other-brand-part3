## Brandshop

### GitHub name other-brand-part3


### Concept
The purpose of this site is to show some of my skills acquired during my studies at Code Institute and from additional online courses. This is a Python and django e-commerce demo site only.


### User story

The site allows the site owner/administrator to display products, and product options, offered for sale to visitors.

The site owner/administrator can show pictures of the products and provide some detailed information about the products. The store owner can also display additional images in a carousel on the home page and create product categories. There is a gallery page showing multiple products, category pages and individual pages for each of the products.

The visitor can read comments from other visitors and add the desired product to the cart after selecting the color and size. There is also a search function available at the top of each page. The visitor can also register and create a profile, which will enable them to rate/review and comment on products as well as complete a purchase.



### UX Design

The site should be easy to navigate. The images should be clearly visible without any distractions. Hence, I didn't use too many colors or colorful backgrounds and frames.
The site is designed to be viewed primarily on a laptop or stationary computer, but should work on mobile screens as well without any major viewing issues.


### Django Admin

The Django backend admin includes: Accounts, User profiles, Group, Carts, Cart Items, Categories, Orders, Order Products, Payments, Store, Product gallery, 
Products, Review ratings, Variations.


### Logged In Features

A special section requiring the user to log-in to gain access has been created. Certain features of the site are only available once the user has logged in. 

Once a user registers to get access to the logged in features a confirmation e-mail will be sent to the registered e-mail address. The e-mail contains a verification link. When the user has verified the account it can be accessed by logging in. Once the user has logged in they will automatically be sent to the dashboard.

Examples of the features 

##### dashboard
##### section displaying your orders
##### edit your personal details/profile
##### change your password
##### checkout cart
##### PayPal payment
##### Once logged-in the user can also review/rate the products and leave comments.
